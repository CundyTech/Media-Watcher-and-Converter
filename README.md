Media-Watcher-and-Converter


This project is aimed at creating a fully fledged folder watcher, that also converts newly downloaded files to a specified format.

The primary goal is to allow for video media files from any platform/Protocol to be downloaded in any format and automatically converted into a user specified format.


Status of Project.

The program does successfully detect new downloads and convert them without any user interaction.

However currently only a one way conversion from MKV to MP4 is available.


Known Bugs.

1.The MKV is converted twice, once when the file download is finished and then again. The cause for the second conversion is currently unknown.
